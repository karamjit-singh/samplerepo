This repo has a small python program which checks whether the given number is prime or not?

1. First of all, the program captures the input from user and checks if the number is greater than 1.
2. If the number is less than equal to 1 then number is not prime.
3. Else check if the modulus of the number is zero for the whole set of integers in that number range.
4. If modulus of the number is zero then number is not a prime number otherwise it's a prime number.
